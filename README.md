#### One Church Roku Real Time Live Streaming App ####
This app was designed for the need to livestream our services to a mother's sitting room on the opposite side of the building from the rest of our AVL. 
Due to the distances involved it was more effective to create a Roku app that would stream the services from our Content Delivery Network in real(ish) time.

Currently the app itself works, however I am working on issues when the stream is offline. To be clear, I am not familiar with the code and I have pieced this
together with the help of other projects I've found and Gemini AI. The second concern I have to take care of is Roku's Developer Package & testing requires 
some level of Deep linking, but I have not figured that out yet either.
